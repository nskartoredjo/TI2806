\section{Description}
The services provider is responsible for a slew of services in the TU Delft campus area. Services include terraces, convenience stores and sports centers. These services need to be provided to all citizens of all the zones in the area. The design of our virtual human is based on the strategy descussed in \ref{sec:appendixa}. However, not every wanted feature has been implemented and thus in this section we will go over every implemented feature in the virtual human.
