\section{Reflection}
In this section we will reflect on the product and the process from a software engineering perspective. We will give information about how to improve and which lessons we have learned during this project.
\subsection{Product}
The final product we have made, is not the product we had in mind at the start of this project. We expected to have more interaction with the bot and a much better strategy. At the start of this project we expected thought that we had to implement a bot. That we had to write a strategy for our bot so it was able to play in the Tygron game. Unfortunately we were wrong. We also had to implement the connector. We had to make sure all the information we needed for the bot, was implemented in the connector. So instead of using the percept, we had to write the percepts. This caused a big change in our plan. Because instead of focusing on a nice strategy, we needed to focus on implementing code to get percepts before even thinking about a strategy. So our final product is now a basic bot, who is able to do basic steps, like building and buying. But a very nice strategy or nice interaction with other bots, is not really there. The improvement for our bot is to have this nice strategy. We weren't able to have this, because we didn't have the information in the connector. Now we have. So for next years it should be able to build the nice strategy we had in mind. Because they don't have to implement anything in the connector, they should be able to think of a strategy and implement this using our code from the connector.

\subsection{Process}
Our process was quit organized. We used SCRUM to plan our sprints and almost every day we worked together. We discussed when we needed to approve pull requests and we helped each other out when there were issues with computers. Because sometimes, some computers had problems running Tygron. Then we would run the code on another computer. 

Final Report: Reflection on the product and process from a software engineering perspective. Write this part of the document.

The reflection covers the product and the process in detail. Includes details such as how to improve and lessons learned.
