\section{Outlook}
Next time we work on this project, we will focus on implementing the strategy. We would like to be able to buy and build only at places that look interesting for the building we want. For example, a terrace should be build at sunny places, where you can sit down an watch people. Instead of building a terrace next to a graveyard. Also convenience stores should be build at places which are easy to reach. Or it would be nice is a parking lot is nearby. The complete strategy we wanted to have is described in appendix A. All this is not yet implemented in our bot, because we didn't have enough time to implement the connector and the bot.
