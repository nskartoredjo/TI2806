\section{Outlook}
Next time we work on this project, we will focus on implementing the strategy. The complete strategy we want to have is described in appendix A. All this is not yet implemented in our bot, because we didn't have enough time to implement the connector and the bot. So next time, we would start implementing this. We would like to have more interaction with the other stakeholders. Also we would like te connector to have more percepts based on our strategy. So we start with implementing the strategy and when we think we need a more specific percept, we would implement this is the connector. Instead of implementing things in the connector and then looking at the strategy. Because we have the basic implementation this is now possible.
