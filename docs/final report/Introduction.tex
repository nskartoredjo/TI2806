\section{Introduction}

This project is build around the Tygron Engine; an urban planning 3D software product. It requires diﬀerent stakeholders to work together in real life locations. This allows all parties to simulate how certain decisions, might inﬂuence everyone participating. All planning is done in real time, which makes the simulation more real, but creates problems requiring every stakeholder to be physically present during the simulation. This is commonly done through Charretes\cite{Todd13}. To combat this problem we are tasked with designing and creating a virtual human, which simulates a real stakeholder by the use of artiﬁcial intelligence programming. This virtual human is designed around a scenario created at the beginning of the project, but should be capable of acting in a multitude of scenario's in order to be of use to any actual simulation involving users of the Tygron Engine.
