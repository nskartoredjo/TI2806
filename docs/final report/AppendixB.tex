\subsection{Appendix B}
In this appendix, we describe the full results of our user study. For each person, we have written their reaction to our questions after each session. Also is given if they were playing against bots or humans.
\subsubsection{person 1 (played twice against a human)}
\textbf{first time}\\
"It is a great game!, I could demolish everything I wanted. I got some permits from other players for building items. It was weird, because the building was already there. When I rejected it, it took some time to let the building disappear. I think I played against a human, because a bot should be faster with reacting to my requests."
\\ \\
\textbf{second time}\\
"This time I played more seriously, so I build more parks instead of demolishing everything. I had to accept and reject the permits from another stakeholder. This time I am not sure if it is a human or a bot, because the placing of the buildings was quite nice and I heard this project wasn't going very well. So I expected not very nice behaviour of the bots. So I think this is a human."

\subsubsection{person 2 (played twice against a human)}
\textbf{first time}\\
"I was just waiting for the other stakeholder to do something. When I got a requests, then I would reject or accept randomly. I got multiple requests for buildings and buying land. It was all at logical places and the reaction time was normal. So I think it was a human."
\\ \\
\textbf{second time}\\
"This time I tried to buy, build and sell by myself. Also I accepted everything the other stakeholder asked. It was almost the same as the first time. So I think this should also be a human."

\subsubsection{person 3 (played twice against a bot)}
\textbf{first time}\\
"It went well, I could build some buildings and even was able to reach one of my indicator goals. I got a lot of requests from another stakeholder. I hadn't reacted to one and then the other was already there. It also had a lot of building at the same time. Because this went really fast, I think it was a bot."
\\ \\
\textbf{second time}\\
"Also this time it went well. I also tried sold some land to another stakeholder for a very high price. But the stakeholder didn't accept this. The stakeholder did again build very fast and a lot. I also saw that not every building had a logical place. I don't know for sure if I played against a bot or a human, because I would have expected that if the stakeholder was a bot that he would accept the land I wanted to sell. A human wouldn't built at those places, thus I think I was a bot." 

\subsubsection{person 4 (played twice against a bot)}
 \textbf{first time}\\
 "It was a easy game. It looked like Sims City. I like the game. I found out that the municipality wants to increase livability. Also I got requests for buying land from another stakeholder. I declined it, because I wanted more money, so I tried to sell the same land for a higher price. But the stakeholder rejected it and kept buying different plots of lands for the same low price. So I kept rejecting. Because it never accepted my sell requests and kept going on trying to buy other plots of lands, I think this was a bot." 
 \\ \\
 \textbf{second time}\\
 "This time I reached all indicators, so I won. Because I didn't need any land, I accepted the buy requests I got. Then the other stakeholder started building nice terraces and convenience stores, which was also good for my indicators. So I only had to accept the price the stakeholder offered for my land. The stakeholder didn't have much variation in what he was doing, so I think it was a bot."

\subsubsection{person 5 (played first against a bot and then against a human)}
\textbf{first time}\\
"It didn't go as expected, because the game was very slow. It didn't react in the way it should. Also it is not possible to change your selected part for building. I saw that another stakeholder was building very fast. It had a lot of buildings in a small amount of time. That is why I think that I played against a bot. A human would never be able to build that fast." 
\\ \\
\textbf{second time} \\ 
"The game still didn't work as expected. It was not clear which zone was the zone you needed for your indicator. Also it is possible to build a building inside another building, so it is not possible to reach this building, this is weird. The stakeholder was still building buildings and I got several permits. This time the building were build at more logical places and it was slower then the first time. So this time I think I played against a human."

\subsubsection{person 6 (played first against a bot and then against a human)}
\textbf{first time}\\
"It went okay, I had to get used to the Tygron game, but after that I could play the game very well. I got a request to buy land and I accepted it. Everything went well when interacting with the other stakeholder. When I tried to buy something, it first rejected it, but when I offered more money it accepted. It was remarkable that the bot always had building of the same size and always next to a road. It looked like the stakeholder was thinking about what he did, but it had some weird actions like building on strange locations. So I think this was a bot"
 \\ \\
\textbf{second time}\\
"Everything went well and the reaction was fast when I send a request. I changed some stuff in my game and the stakeholder rejected or accepted alternately. It built at logic locations. There weren't very remarkable thinks going on. But the things that happen were less predictable, so I think this time is was a human."
