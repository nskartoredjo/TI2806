\section{Overview}
In this section we will give an overview of the developed and implemented software product. The developed product consists of a combination of software features. The two features are the Tygron Environment Connector and the GOAL Services Virtual Human. The architecture of the product consists of the GSVH connecting to Tygron Engine through our TEC. The virtual human can retrieve information about the game and send actions to the game through the connector. The complete architecture of the product is discussed in our Architecture Design Report\cite{CTD16}. Over the course of the project we had to build on a pre-existing connector wich severely lacked any useful features for implementing a GOAL driven virtual human. As mentioned before, the virtual human is built using the GOAL Agent Programming Language \cite{GOAL16}.
