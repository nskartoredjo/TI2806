\section{Interaction Design}

\subsection{Goal}
The goal of our user study was to see how other players interact with our bot and how they experienced it. Because we need to replace a human by a bot, it should almost be like playing with a real human. So we needed to know what were the difference between playing with a bot or playing with a human.

\subsection{Procedure}
We tested six persons using our code.  All six test persons were TI students which are also doing a context project, but they had another context. 
First we had to explain the tygron game to our test persons, because they need to have an understanding of the game and it has a lot of options. So we needed to take time for explaining this. 
\\ \\
Then we need to explain them the tasks they had to do. The needed to play the game twice. This could be twice against a bot, or twice against a human. Also it could be once against a human and once against a bot. They had to play the game and reach there goals in the games. This could be done by building, buying, selling and demolishing. By doing this they also had to interact with the other player. 
\\ \\
After they played the game, we asked them how it went and if they thought they played with a bot or a human. Also they need to explain why they thought that. 
\\ \\
These results were gathered together and written down. In this way we could find out if they could sense that they were playing against our bot.
\subsection{Results}
The complete results are given in appendix B.
When we looked at the results, we saw that everybody was right about when they played against a human or a bot. There is only one person who doubt a little bit. But most of the times it was very clear when they played. The overall comment we got, was that the bot wasn't building on logical places, so We could adjust this to add more strategy in deciding where to build or buy. Another reaction we got was that when buying land and getting rejected, it tries to find another piece of land to buy instead of accepting to buy this land for a higher price. We intended to do this, but if the municipality keeps rejecting our request, then we have to buy it for a higher price. The last comment we got was that the bot is faster than a human.
