\section{Appendix A}
In this section we describe what strategy we wanted to have for our bot. Also we will describe what strategy we really have.
\subsection{What we wanted as a strategy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item behaviour concerning buildings:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  A building should be able to change the indicators for services.
		\item A building should be able to change indicators for other stakeholders.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This could be an advantage or an disadvantage for other stakeholders.
			\item For example increase the green indicator or nuisance.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\end{itemize}
	\item behaviour concerning building:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A building could be build if this has the highest priority looking at the indicators.
		\item A building could be build if this has positive results for all indicators.
		\item A building should be build with a realistic shape.
		\item A building should be build within the given size or area.
		\item A building should be build based on other buildings and locations.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For example next to roads or close to other buildings you own..
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item behaviour concerning demolishing:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A building could be demolished only when it has a minimum effect for that indicator.
		\item A building could be demolished if it isn't any of the buildings services want to have, but services does own this building.
		\item A building could be demolished if this is cheaper to use this land than buying new land.
	\end{itemize}
	\item behaviour concerning selling:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	A building should be sold when it has a minimum effect on that indicator and the money we get is enough to cover building the exact same building.E
		\item	Land should be only be sold if we have enough land and we get enough money for this land.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	There is enough land if all indicators have a 100$\%$ score or when this can be reached.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item behaviour concerning buying:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	Land should be bought in realistic shapes. 
		\item 	Land should be bought from other stakeholders if there is no land to build on and the indicators don't have a 100$\%$ score yet.
		\item	Land should be bought if there is no land to build on and if the price for buying is better then demolishing or if demolishing is not an option.
		\item	Land should be bought if it is in a zone which is useful looking at the indicators.
		\item	Land should be bought when it doesn't have any buildings on it.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If this is not the case, we need to buy land that has  building on it.
		\end{itemize}		
		\item	Land should be bought if other stakeholders are offering this land.
		\item	Land should be bought only when it is for an acceptable price.
	\end{itemize}
	\item behaviour concerning interaction with other stakeholders:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	The stakeholders should be able to stop buying and selling of buildings or land if this has negative effects on our indicators.
		\item 	The stakeholder should be able to send messages to each other.
		\item 	Municipality should be able to accept or reject building permits from services.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A new building permit should be reviewed by municipality when old building permits are rejected.
		\end{itemize}
	\item	Services should be able to send a building permit to municipality when a building is build.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Services should be able to send another building permit is an old permit gets rejected by municipality.
	\end{itemize}	
	\item	Services should be able to offer land to other stakeholders.
	\item	Services should be able to negotiate and compete with other stakeholders about the price for selling and buying land.
	\item 	Services should be able to negotiate and compete by giving secondary gifts.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For example increase the green indicator or give money to other stakeholders.
	\end{itemize}	
	\item	Services should be able to get more respect from other stakeholders by giving gifts, so we are able to do more when negotiating with these stakeholders.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
