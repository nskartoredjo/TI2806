\section{Request Testing}
It is not possible to write a test for request because we need another player to make the requests.

In order to test if the request are working properly, Below there  are some scenario's to describe how it should work.

Select a part of the land of services to buy from.
Fill in the price per m2 you want to pay for this land.
Send the request.
