\section{Permit Testing}
It is not possible to write a test for permits because we need another player to check if the permit was send properly.

In order to test if the permits are working properly, Below there  is a scenario to describe how permits should work.

The bot doesn't have any strategy yet. This will be done later.

\subsection{Send permit request}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start the Tygron game.
	\item Run the bot.
	\item Join the game the bot is on.
	\item choose municipality as stakeholder.
	\item wait until the bot builds something.
	\item wait for the bot to send a permit to build the building..
	\item accept this permit..
	\item wait the bot to build another building.
	\item wait for the permit for this building..
	\item Accept this permit.
\end{itemize}
