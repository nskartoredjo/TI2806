\section{Introduction}

Tygron is a company that builds serious games for urban planning.
A game usually consist of a scenario (such as planning a new city area) in which several players play different roles (such as major, city planner, environmental agency, etc.)
So, these games are meant to be played by a group of people.
Tygron is interested in simulating some of these people with Virtual Humans, so that you can play the serious game also when not every player in the scenario is present. This is useful, because it is hard to make an appointment when everybodyy is available. By replacing the roles with Virtual Humans, it is easier to make an appointment and even be able to play the game on your own. In this way you can play the game more often, or have more time to execute the plans for real.

The Virtual Human developed by us will take the roll of a public service manager. Its goal is to build shops, parking places, restaurants and such in optimal location so that profit can be made.
