\subsection{High-level product backlog}

Within this section the high-level features will be defined using \textit{MoSCoW}. MoSCoW uses four categories to separate the features by level of importance. The categories are:

\begin{description}
	\item[Must Have:] Features that are of high importance. With those features the agent is considered as properly working.
	\item[Should Have:] Features that are considered favourable. Without the agent should still be functional and should properly work.
	\item[Could Have:] Features that are of low importance. When there will be enough time to implement, the features will be present.
	\item[Won't Have:] Features that won't be implemented.
\end{description}
