\subsection{Subsystem decomposition}
\subsection{Hardware/software mapping}
\subsection{Persistent data management}
Our GOAL agent is not responsible for storing persistent data, so it does not have external files or databases. Everything is stored on the database of the Tygron server.
\subsection{Concurrency}
Our GOAL Agent is just one process. It shares recourses with other users of the tygron environment. If a deadlock occurs, this would be on the tygron environment. Our GOAL system won't have issues with deadlocks.
