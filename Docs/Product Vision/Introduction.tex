\section{Introduction}
This project is built around the Tygron Engine; an urban planning 3D software product. It requires different stakeholders to work together in real life locations. This allows all parties to simulate how certain decisions might influence everyone participating. All planning is done in real time, which makes the simulation more real, but creates problems requiring every stakeholder to be physically present during the simulation. To combat this problem, teams from the Delft University of Technology are asked to create a virtual human, which simulates a real stakeholder by the use of artificial intelligence programming. \newline

In the next sections a couple of questions will be answered about our product and the vision we have as a group.
\newline
\begin{itemize}
\item Who is going to buy the product? Who is the target customer?
\item Which customer needs will the product address?
\item Which product attributes are crucial to satisfy the selected needs, and therefore to the success of the product?
\item How does the product compare against existing products, both from competitors and the same company? What are the productï¿½s unique selling points? 
\item What is the target timeframe and budget to develop and launch the product?

\end{itemize}
