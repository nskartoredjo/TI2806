\section{Which customer needs will the product address?}



The Tygron Engine can be used to create serious games in urban planning. In urban planning many stakeholders are involved such as the mayor, housing corporation and the inhabitants. This means that it requires multiple users to play a game in the engine. It is imaginable that users want to be able to play the game independently of other users. Our product provides a single-player mode. There are still multiple stakeholders, but those that can not be played by actual players are replaced by virtual humans. In specific our product will imitate the behavior of an organisation that provides services to the inhabitants of the area. The users need to interact with this agent as if with a human. When a user plays the game it must feel realistic as if it is a multi-player mode game. \newline



So in general the customer need to play the game individually will be adressed by the product by imitating the role of a service provider in the urban area.
