\section{Timeframe and budget}
The project is done by a group of five students from the Delft University of Technology commissioned by Tygron. The group is given a timeframe of ten weeks, of which the first two weeks are meant for creating a game in which the virtual humans are to work in. The following eight weeks are spent on designing and coding the virtual human for the Tygron Engine.\newline

The students do not have or need a budget to succesfully complete the project. \newline
