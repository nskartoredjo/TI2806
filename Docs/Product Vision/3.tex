\section{Which product attributes are crucial to satisfy the selected needs, and therefore to the success of the product?}

For the agent to imitate the behavior of a service provider it has to fulfill certain requirements. These requirements contain the ability to perform the basic actions of the Tygron Engine and complex thinking on its own specific to a service provider. The requirements and are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The agent must be able to perform he basic actions of the Tygron Engine.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct buildings
	\item Demolish buildings
	\item Buy land
	\item Sell land
	\item Consult indicators
	\end{enumerate}

\item The agent must be able to compute an effective strategy to reach the targets set.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interpret indicators and use the information to adjust strategy
	\item Interact with other stakeholders
	\item Calculate optimal placing of buildings
	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate} \newline

So by being able to perform those actions the agent will be fully functional as an imitator.
